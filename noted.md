## Elevator Pitch 

## Key Features

## Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

__HTML__ - Structre the aoo with HTML elements. Four HTML pages. One for Home Page which will include a login. One for Emotion rating using buttions. One for Journaling for the user to wrote down thier feelings. One for calming excercises it will include a bteathing excise and visual aid.Hyperlinks or navigation components for movement between sections.

__CSS__ - Create a clean and calming aestetic. Use CSS to get nice soft blues, and fonts.

__JavaScript__ - Add interactivity into the app. Validates the login. Handles user interactions when user rates emotions. 

__React__ - Breaks down app into reusable components. LoginForm, JournalForm, and EmotionRating. State management rack user inputs (e.g., journal entries, emotion ratings) and synchronize with the database.

__Web Service__ - Create backend endpoints for saving journal entires and emotion ratings.

__Authetication__ - Implement user authentication. After login, display a personalized greeting with the userâ€™s name.

__Database Data__ - Store data in a database. Emotion ratings and journal entries. 

__WebSocket Data__ - Send daily motivational messages to all logged-in users in real time. A user logs in, and a real-time notification appears

## Design Images

__Vite__ - a JavaScript build tool that helps developers build modern web projects faster and more efficiently.

__bootstrap__ - a free, open-source front-end development framework that allows developers to quickly build responsive websites by providing pre-designed HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components like buttons, grids, forms, and navigation menus

__REACT__ - a JavaScript library used to build user interfaces (UIs) for web and mobile applications.\

__JSX__ - JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that lets you write HTML-like markup inside a JavaScript file
