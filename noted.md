## Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

__HTML__ - Structre the aoo with HTML elements. Four HTML pages. One for Home Page which will include a login. One for Emotion rating using buttions. One for Journaling for the user to wrote down thier feelings. One for calming excercises it will include a bteathing excise and visual aid.Hyperlinks or navigation components for movement between sections.

__CSS__ - Create a clean and calming aestetic. Use CSS to get nice soft blues, and fonts.

__JavaScript__ - Add interactivity into the app. Validates the login. Handles user interactions when user rates emotions. 

__React__ - Breaks down app into reusable components. LoginForm, JournalForm, and EmotionRating. State management rack user inputs (e.g., journal entries, emotion ratings) and synchronize with the database.
