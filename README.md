## Elevator Pitch 

Have you ever struggled to make sense of your emotions after a tough day, or felt unsure how to calm your mind when stress takes over? The Emotional Check-In app offers a simple, effective way to reconnect with yourself. Users can log how they’re feeling, journal their thoughts, and practice calming exercises.
