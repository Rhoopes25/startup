## Elevator Pitch 

Have you ever struggled to make sense of your emotions after a tough day, or felt unsure how to calm your mind when stress takes over? The Emotional Check-In app offers a simple, effective way to reconnect with yourself. Users can log how they’re feeling, journal their thoughts, and practice calming exercises. As you track your emotions over time, the app helps you recognize patterns and build emotional resilience. It’s a safe, supportive tool to help you feel heard, understood, and more in control of your well-being. 

## Key Features

## Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

__HTML__ - Structure with HTML elements. Four HTML pages. One for Home Page which will include a login. One for Emotion rating using buttons. One is for Journaling where the user can write down their feelings. One for calming exercises will include a breathing exercise and visual aid. Hyperlinks or navigation components for movement between sections.

__CSS__ - Create a clean and calming aesthetic. Use CSS to get nice soft blues and fonts.

__JavaScript__ - Add interactivity to the app. Validates the login. Handles user interactions when a user rates emotions.  

__React__ - Breaks down the app into reusable components. LoginForm, JournalForm, and EmotionRating. State management rack user inputs (e.g., journal entries, emotion ratings) and synchronize with the database.

__Web Service__ - Create backend endpoints for saving journal entries and emotion ratings.

__Authetication__ - Implement user authentication. After login, display a personalized greeting with the user’s name.

__Database Data__ - Store data in a database. Emotion ratings and journal entries. 

__WebSocket Data__ - Send daily motivational messages to all logged-in users in real-time. A user logs in, and a real-time notification appears
